1. Code:Knapsack.java
Problem Statement:
Given a list of n integers, A={a1,a2,…,an}, and other interger, k representing the expected sum. Select zero or more numbers form A such that the sum of these numbers is as near as possible , but not exceeding to the expected sum(k).
Note 
a. Each element of A can be selected multiple times.
b. If  no element is selected then sum is 0.

Constraints 
1≤T≤10
1≤n≤2000
1≤k≤2000
1≤ai≤2000,where ibelong to set [1,n]

For example 
input array: 1 6 9, Expected sum=12
Optimum Value=12
input array 3 4 4 4 8, Expected sum = 9
Optimum value =9
